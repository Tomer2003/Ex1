# Matrix
The Matrix library contains commands that are executed on matrices such as: 
 creating a matrix, arithmetic operations, returning values, deep copying, changing values and freeing up memory.



# ErrorCode
The ErrorCode library contains commands that can check if there was an 
error in one of the commands we made on the matrix and also return the error type.

# Tests
I did a test for every action that Matrix can do.
